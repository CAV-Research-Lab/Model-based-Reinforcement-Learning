   The debris could be stationary or rotating about some arbitrary axis. The aim is to capture the debris and bring it back to a station.

   The big cube is assumed to be the spacecraft and carries a robot arm which has seven rotary joints and has a gripper with two linear joints.

### Reward:
Currently it is composed of three parts.

dist = distance between end-effector and debris  # to reach near the debris

act = 0.0001 * np.dot(action, action) # to obtain minimal actuator torques

rw_vel = 0.001 * sum of squares of base linear and angular velocites # for reaction-less control

reward = -(dist + act + rw_vel)

**Note:** As of now there is no reward for grasping
### Current issues:

    * How to set reward for grasping?
    Is it could be just negative of the distance between the end-effector and debris
    or add a camera and get images at every instant of time?
    * Training the Dynamics model


### Ideas
1. Demonstrated replay buffer
2. Reaction-less control
